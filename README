Read Me
================
This was part of 2 of Project 2 for COMS W4112.001 : DATABASE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. 
This part builds one component of a basic infrastructure for a database system, the heap file (a linear hash index is currently being built for Part 2
and will be posted the week of April 23rd, 2012). The heap file has capability to insert records as well as search records (i.e., cursor facilities).


Packages
--------
We have multiple packages.

Interfaces - This package stores the interface ‘Compare’ that holds method declarations - read, write, and compare.

Compare - This package holds the classes that implement the ‘Compare’ interface for different possible datatypes that are in the CSV file input.

Util - This package has the classes that are used in the program to parse the input, create the associated Heap and CSV Files.

Helper - This package has the Helper class that holds the function to convert the data types used in the CSV file to bytes and write it to memory.

Tester - This package holds the Main driver class that accepts the user input and generates the output.


Execution
----------
To execute
cd project_folder_path/src/
javac */*.java

java Tester/Test heapfile -i “<” example.acsv    --- create a new heap , or append to an existing heap

java Tester/Test heapfile  --- dump the heap contents to a CSV file example_result.acsv

to see the resultant file - cat example_result.acsv


Sample Tests
-------------
Query heap file two conditions one column
  heapfile -s1 <> orson -s1 <> ingrid -s3 = 1915
In Linux : java Tester/test    heapfile "-s1" "<>" orson "-s1" "<>" ingrid "-s3" "=" 1915
  Result: NONE
  PASSED

Query heap file three conditions one column, two on one column
  heapfile -s1 <> orson -s1 <> andy -s3 > 1914 -s3 < 1916 -s3 <> 1915
In Linux :  java Tester/Test heapfile "-s1" "<>" orson "-s1" "<>" andy "-s3" ">" 1914 "-s3" "<" 1916 "-s3" "<>" 1915

  Result: Ingrid, Bergman
  PASSED

Query heap file three conditions one column, two on one column, illegal projection
  heapfile -s1 <> orson -s1 <> andy -s3 > 1914 -s3 < 1916 -s3 = 1915 -p1 -p100
In Linux : java Tester/Test heapfile "-s1" "<>" orson "-s1" "<>" andy "-s3" ">" 1914 "-s3" "<" 1916 "-s3" "=" 1915 -p1 -p100
  Result: Sorry. That column for projection does not exist.
  PASSED

Query heap file three conditions one column, two on one column, illegal column selection
   heapfile -s100 <> orson -s1 <> andy -s3 > 1914 -s3 < 1916 -s3 = 1915 -p1
In Linux : java Tester/Test heapfile "-s100" "<>" orson "-s1" "<>" andy "-s3" ">" 1914 "-s3" "<" 1916 "-s3" "=" 1915 -p1
   Result: Sorry. That column for query does not exist.
   PASSED

Query heap file two conditions on two columns
   heapfile -s1 <> orson -s1 = ingrid -s4 > 1.70 -s4 < 1.80

   Result: record (ingrid)
   PASSED



Print all records
In Linux :     java Tester/Test heapfile

cat example_result.acsv
   heapfile
   Result:
   PASSED

Append example.acsv to heap again, query: -s3 = 1915
